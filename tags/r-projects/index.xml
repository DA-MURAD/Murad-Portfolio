      <description>Introduction In this case study, I will perform data analysis for a fictional bike-share called Cyclistic.In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.</description>
